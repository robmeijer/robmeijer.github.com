{"name":"Rob Meijer","body":"### About Me\r\nHalf South-African, half Dutch, all geek. And proud of it.\r\n\r\nI'm an avid PC gamer, can't get through my day without music, and obsess too much about movies and TV shows.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm not busy with one of those, I can be found converting caffeine into code.\r\n\r\n### What I Do\r\nI've been doing Web Development since 1999 when I first learned HTML to clean up a company website.\r\n\r\nApart from the occasional job requirement, it remained a hobby for 10 years while I taught myself PHP, MySQL, and various other related languages.\r\n\r\nThese days I work as a full-time developer, and absolutely love it.\r\n\r\n### Current Projects\r\n* **Seer** - A shopping cart/CMS built using Laravel.\r\n* **WS-Responsive** - A single HTML page to demonstrate a responsive layout that may be used for future front-end development.\r\n* **Theme_Autumn** - A new CMS theme.","google":"","tagline":"PHP, HTML and CSS development","note":"Don't delete this file!
